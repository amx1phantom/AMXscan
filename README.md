# AMXScan 1.0 🚀

AMXScan is an **advanced, lightweight, and stealthy** port scanner designed for ethical penetration testing and network security assessments. Built for **Linux** and **Perlbrot**, this tool helps cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers scan networks **anonymously** while maintaining **high stealth levels**.

### **Features**:
- ✔ **Full & Specific Port Scanning** – Scan all ports or define a specific range.
- ✔ **Stealth Mode** – Bypass detection systems and scan without leaving a trace.
- ✔ **Variable Usage** – Use custom commands for precise control.
- ✔ **Timeout Functionality** – Adjust scan timeouts for efficiency.
- ✔ **OS Detection** – Identify target operating systems and databases. *(Advanced OS detection coming soon!)*
- ✔ **Output File Generation** – Save scan results for future analysis.

### **Why AMXScan?**
Unlike traditional scanners like **Nmap**, AMXScan is built with **anonymity and stealth** in mind. It helps security professionals conduct scans while remaining undetected.

### **Installation on Linux**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMX!Phantom/amxscan.git  
cd amxscan  
chmod +x amxscan.py  
python amxscan.py --help.
```
Ethical Use Notice!!!⚠️:
AMXScan is strictly for ethical penetration testing and legitimate network security assessments. Any other use? 🤫 Let's just say... that's not the kind of "testing" we endorse. The developer takes no responsibility for any mischief!

For maximum anonymity and protection, always run AMXScan through secure networks like VPNs or Tor. Remember, if you’re really trying to stay off the radar, using Tor (or an even more powerful VPN) will keep you as elusive as a shadow. 🕵️‍♂️
